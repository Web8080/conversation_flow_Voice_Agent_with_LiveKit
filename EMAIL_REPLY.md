Hi [Recruiter Name],

Thank you for the opportunity! I've successfully built and deployed the voice agent - the backend is running on LiveKit Cloud and fully functional, with all services (Google STT, Gemini LLM, Google TTS) working correctly as confirmed through CLI testing. I'm currently troubleshooting a minor dispatch API issue on the Vercel frontend deployment, but the agent itself is operational and responding to voice interactions. Would it be possible to grant me an additional 48-72 hours to perfect the frontend deployment so you can interact with the agent directly through the Vercel link? In the meantime, I've made all my work available on GitHub for your review: [GitHub Repository Link]. I'm confident I'll have everything polished and fully deployed within this timeframe.

Best regards,
Victor
